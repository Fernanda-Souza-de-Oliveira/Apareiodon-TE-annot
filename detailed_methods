Detailed methods: TE distribution and activity on Apareiodon sp. genome

Distribution of TEs on Apareiodon sp. scaffolds
# Divide genome in 1Mb fragments
$ bedtools makewindows -g Apar_genome.fasta.length -w 1000000 -s 100000 > genome_windows.bed

# TE coverage on genome
$ bedtools coverage -a genome_windows.bed -b apareiodon_te_annot.gff > genome_coverage.out
- For the distribution of TE superfamilies the script coverage_superf.sh was used, which runs the above code for each TE superfamily separately.

# The statistical difference in the distribution of TEs in the genome was calculated and plotted according to the R script anova_tukey.R
- For the statistical differences of specific TE superfamilies between scaffolds, the same script was applied, on separated coverage files for each superfamily.

Ages of TE insertions
# To calculate the average age of TE families, insertions bigger than 100 bp were extracted from the TE annotation, and random 1000 insertions were selected for families with a high number of copies. 
$ grep $line apareiodon_te_annot.gff | awk '{if($5-$4>100){print$0}}' | shuf -n 1000 | bedtools getfasta -fi Apar_genome.fasta -bed - > ${line}.fa

# Sequences were aligned on mafft, and trimmed with trimal.
$ mafft --auto ${line}.fa > ${line}.aln
$ trimal -in ${line}.aln -gt 0.01 -keepheader > ${line}.trim.aln

# Trees were built with FastTree. 
$ FastTree -nt -gamma < ${line}.trim.aln.sub > ${line}.tree

# Terminal branch lengths were extracted with the termlength.py script

# medians were calculated using the median function in R, and statistical analysis on median TE age from different superfamilies and the correlations between the number of insertions in a family and age were calculated with the te_age.R script

Full-length copies characterization
# Insertions possessing at least 90% of its consensus size were extracted from the annotation file with the script TE_len.py.  

# Fasta sequences from the full-length insertions were extracted and translated into amino acids. 
$ grep $line full-length_copies.gff | awk -v OFS='\t' '{ print $1, $4, $5 }' | bedtools getfasta -fi Apar_genome.fasta -bed - > ${line}.fa
$ for f in *.fa; do transeq -sequence $f -outseq $f.aa -frame 6 -clean; done

# Amino acid sequences were submitted to InterPro Scan to check for TE protein domains.
$ for f in *.aa; do ./interproscan.sh -i $f -o $f.out

# Sequences with all the respective families' characteristic TE protein domains were extracted and aligned.
$ for f in *.out; do grep DDE_3 $f | awk '{print $1}' | sed 's/:/\t/g' | sed 's/-/\t/g' | bedtools getfasta -fi Apar_genome.fasta -bed - > $f.fasta; done
  * Pull sequences with protein domains specific from each superfamily (e.g. Tc1-Mariner: DDE_3; hAT: zf-BED, Dimer_tnp_hAT)
$ for f in *.fasta; do mafft --reorder --adjustdirection $f > $f.aln; done
  * Alignments were visualized on Aliview software and non-conserved sequences were removed.

# Consensus sequences were generated from alignments with conserved sequences. 
$ for f in *edit.aln; do cons -sequence $f -outseq $f.cons; done

# The consensus were checked on TE-aid software for other structural characteristics.
